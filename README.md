### Wins
This project was very difficult as it introduced working with two different classes.  Through research and mentoring I was able to create a playable game that I am proud of.  I was introduced to new concepts and methods that I will use for future projects.

### Challenges
As stated before, the introduction of two different classes was an obstacle to overcome.  It was a slow process to fully understand the interactions between the two classes and a JavaScript page for just manipulating the DOM.  

### Future Iterations
- Ability to choose an advanced game
- Ability to share your score on social media 
- Ability to have two human players compete against each other
